## About Planora
Planora is a project management system currently being developed by a small group of students from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), as part of the Database and Web Application Laboratory course. It is designed to serve both individual users and teams who seek to efficiently manage their projects.

The primary objective of the project is to create a web-based information system for project management. This includes task assignment and tracking for each team member, setting deadlines, and organising work teams. The tool is flexible, allowing it to be used in both individual projects and large-scale team collaborations.

## Features
Each task will include detailed information about the user who created it and the individual responsible for its completion. Tasks will also allow comments from other members, providing an additional channel for feedback and collaboration.

Users are organized into groups with varying permission levels. These groups include the aforementioned administrators, who have full access and modification rights; project managers, responsible for team assignments and project coordenation, and setting deadlines; and team members, who are limited to viewing and managing only the tasks assigned to them.
